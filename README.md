# Dual-Frame Research Group: Core Theory Hub

This repository serves as the primary theoretical foundation for **Dual-Frame Theory (DFT)**—a developmental exposition of physics based on the primacy of motion. DFT provides a unified geometric framework that links macroscopic quantum phenomena to microscopic atomic structures through the mechanics of **T-frame winding sectors**.

## 1. Overview
Dual-Frame Theory (DFT) departs from background-dependent physics by postulating that space and time are the reciprocal aspects of a universal scalar motion. By projecting this motion through two distinct frames—the **Temporal/Trajectory (T)** frame and the **Spatial/Standard (S)** frame—we derive the laws of physics as consequences of topological coherence and background curvature.



## 2. Key Theoretical Pillars

### 2.1 Winding Sector Selection
Quantization is a topological requirement. For a motion-trajectory to project stably into the S-frame, it must satisfy a winding condition on the compact T-frame manifold. This governs the discrete energy levels of atomic orbitals and the quantized fluxoids in superconductivity.

### 2.2 The Coherence Hierarchy
DFT reinterprets "quantum" coherence as the stability of the T-frame phase-lock. 
* **1st Order:** Visibility in interferometry ($V$).
* **2nd Order:** Phase-driven bunching and correlation ($g^2$).
* **Long-Range:** Joint phase dynamics and the emergence of Bell correlations.

### 2.3 The Coherence Aperture ($L$)
The theory predicts a natural limit to phase-locking at approximately $3.8 \, a_0$. This aperture defines the boundary where the T-frame manifold transitions from a locked resonance to a decoherent state, providing the geometric rationale for the structure of the Periodic Table.
