# 2. Mechanics of Winding Sectors

## 2.1 The Principle of Topological Closure

In Chapter 1, we established that physical entities are displacements from the Unit Datum. For a displacement to persist as a stable physical state, the underlying T-frame motion must be **topologically closed**.

The T-frame describes motion on compact manifolds. On such manifolds, phase must remain globally consistent. If a trajectory fails to close, the phase Θ becomes multi-valued under projection into the S-frame. This destroys global coherence, and the displacement relaxes toward the Unit Datum.

Topological closure is therefore the stability condition for persistent physical structure.

This closure requirement is geometric, not dynamical. It arises from the admissibility of mappings between compact T-frame topology and extensive S-frame projection.

### 2.1.1 The Winding Condition

Let Θ : Λ → ℳₜ be the phase map on a compact T-frame manifold ℳₜ, where Λ is the scalar motion parameter.

Stability requires that the total phase change around any closed trajectory γ satisfies:

ΔΘ = ∮γ dΘ = 2π n, n ∈ ℤ

The integer n is the **winding number**, and defines the **winding sector**.

Each winding sector represents a distinct admissible motion class. Because winding number is a topological invariant, transitions between sectors require global reconfiguration rather than continuous deformation.

Discrete winding sectors therefore appear in the S-frame as discrete physical states.

Quantization is thus a consequence of topological admissibility.

## 2.2 Macroscopic Manifestation: the dc SQUID

Macroscopic quantum interference systems provide direct physical realization of winding sectors.

The clearest example is the **dc SQUID (Superconducting Quantum Interference Device)**.

---

### 2.2.1 Flux as Projection of Phase Closure

In a superconducting loop, the T-frame phase Θ remains coherent across the entire system.

External magnetic flux modifies the global phase configuration. Because phase must remain single-valued, the winding condition enforces:

Φ_total = Φ_ext + L·I = n Φ₀

where:

Φ₀ = h / (2e)

is the flux quantum.

Flux quantization is therefore the S-frame projection of integer winding closure in the T-frame.

This relationship does not depend on microscopic particle trajectories, but on global phase admissibility.

---

### 2.2.2 Winding Sector Selection and Projection Energy

Each winding sector corresponds to a distinct admissible phase configuration.

Maintaining closure requires curvature in phase structure. This curvature projects into the S-frame as measurable energy.

The projection energy associated with winding sector n may be written schematically:

E_Σ(n) = E_winding(n) + E_projection(n)

Transitions between sectors occur where adjacent winding configurations have equal projection energy.

These transitions are experimentally observed as fluxoid switching and interference modulation.

The existence of discrete winding sectors is therefore empirically established.

---

## 2.3 Microscopic Manifestation: Atomic Orbitals

The same closure structure governs atomic systems.

In Σ-Order theory, the electron is represented not as a localized point object but as a **global winding configuration of phase in the T-frame**.

The orbital observed in the S-frame is the projection of this winding structure.

---

### 2.3.1 Orbital Structure as Winding Classes

Atomic orbitals correspond to distinct winding sectors.

The principal quantum number n corresponds to primary winding number.

Angular quantum numbers correspond to transverse winding topology and projection symmetry.

Because winding number is topologically quantized, intermediate configurations are not admissible.

Discrete atomic energy levels therefore arise from admissible winding structure.

Quantization reflects geometric admissibility rather than imposed quantization rules.

---

### 2.3.2 Resolution of Apparent Degeneracy

Local dynamical models may predict degeneracy between certain orbital states.

Experimentally, small but reproducible splittings occur.

Within Σ-Order theory, this follows directly from geometric structure.

Distinct winding classes couple differently to background projection curvature.

Even when spatial projections appear similar, underlying T-frame topology differs.

These differences produce distinct projection energies.

Observed spectral splitting therefore reflects geometric admissibility of winding structure.

---

## 2.4 Summary of Winding Sector Structure

| Property | SQUID (Macroscopic) | Atom (Microscopic) |
|--------|---------------------|--------------------|
| Winding entity | Superconducting phase | Orbital phase structure |
| Quantized invariant | Winding number n | Winding number n |
| Stability condition | Fluxoid closure | Orbital closure |
| Observable projection | Current / voltage interference | Spectral energy levels |

In both cases, quantization arises from topological closure on compact manifolds.

Quantization is therefore structural, not imposed.

---

## 2.5 Background Phase Geometry (BPG)

The Unit Datum represents coherent scalar progression.

Projection from compact T-frame topology into extensive S-frame structure introduces intrinsic geometric constraints.

These constraints define the **Background Phase Geometry (BPG)**.

The BPG governs admissible projection structure and energy relationships.

---

### 2.5.1 Intrinsic Projection Curvature

Closure on compact manifolds generally requires curvature in phase configuration.

This curvature exists even in the absence of localized structure.

It is a property of admissible projection geometry.

This intrinsic curvature scale is denoted:

κ_Σ

κ_Σ is a universal structural parameter governing projection relationships.

It does not represent a force field, but a geometric property of admissible mappings between T-frame and S-frame.

---

### 2.5.2 Empirical Manifestation in Atomic Structure

Background curvature produces measurable differences in projection energy between winding classes.

This appears experimentally as spectral splitting between atomic states.

The splitting reflects geometric differences in admissible winding structure.

This interpretation is geometric and structural.

It does not require auxiliary dynamical assumptions.

---

### 2.5.3 The Coherence Aperture L

Empirical analysis identifies a characteristic projection coherence scale:

L ≈ 3.8 a₀

where a₀ is the Bohr radius.

This defines the effective coherence aperture of projection structure.

Inside this aperture, winding coherence remains stable.

Beyond this aperture, projection coherence weakens.

This scale governs admissibility of extended winding configurations.

---

## 2.6 Projection Energy Structure

The projection energy associated with a winding class arises from geometric admissibility requirements.

This may be expressed schematically as:

E_total(n) = E_winding(n) + E_BPG(κ_Σ, n)

where:

E_winding(n) arises from topological closure,

and

E_BPG arises from coupling to background projection curvature.

These components are structural consequences of admissible projection geometry.

They are not independent dynamical forces.

Quantized physical structure therefore arises from admissible winding topology and geometric projection consistency.

Quantization emerges as a structural necessity of phase closure on compact manifolds.
